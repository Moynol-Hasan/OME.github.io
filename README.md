Project Tittle: Ami Coding Pari Na

Description: In this project, the user needs to log in first. If the user is not registered then he/she needs to register first. After logging in, the user enters some values as input then again user enters a value for searching. If that value is present in the values entered by the user, the output would be true otherwise, it would be false.

Features:
On the front page, there are 2 features. One is login and the other one is signup. If a user is not already registered, he or she must first register by providing a name, email address, password, and confirm password. These details are kept in the phpMyAdmin database. After completing registration, users can log in to the next phase. In the login phase, the user needs to enter email and password to log in.

After logging in, the user enters some values as input first, then the user will enter a value for searching from the stored values. If the searched value is present in the first input values then the output shows true otherwise false.

Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Php.


How to run the application:

First, open xampp and turn on Apache and MySQL. Then create a database in phpMyAdmin. Then give name of the database 'test' and the table name 'signup'. The database consists of 4 columns which are name, email, password, and confirm_Passowrd. Here email should be unique constraints.

Then need to store the files in the local disk -> Xampp -> htdocs. Then go to any browser and search for localhost/'Folder name'

Then you need to signup first, if you're not registered. After completing the registration, come to the sign-in page and then use email and password to log in. After logging in, it will take to the next page which is "khoj the search" page. On this page, first input some values then in the next step, search for a value. If the value is found then the output shows True else it shows False.
