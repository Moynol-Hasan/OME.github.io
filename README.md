How to run the application:

First I need to open xampp and need to turn on Apache and MySQL.
Then I need to create a database in phpmyadmin.
I named the database 'test' and the table name 'signup'. The database consists of 4 columns. Which are name, email, password, and confirm_Passowrd. And I used unique constraints in email.

I need to store my file in local disk->Xampp->htdocs
Then I come to my browser and search for localhost/'folder name'

Then I need to signup first if I'm not registered. After the registration, I come to the sign-in page and then I use my email and password to log in. After login, it will take me to the next page which is khoj the search page. On this page first I input some values then in the next step, I search for a value. If the value is found then the output show true else it shows false.
